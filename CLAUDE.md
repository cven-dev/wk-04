# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Week 4 course material for CVEN 5999: Special Topics - Data Analytics for Development, focusing on data transformation using dplyr and working with complex datasets.

## Week 4 Content

- **Data Transformation**: Advanced dplyr operations
- **Complex Datasets**: Municipal solid waste (MSW) data analysis
- **Project Work**: Applying transformation techniques to real data

## File Structure

- `live-04a-data-transformation.qmd`: Live coding for data transformation
- `hw-04a-data-transformation.qmd`: Homework on transformation techniques
- `hw-04b-project.qmd`: Project-focused assignment
- `learning-04.qmd`: Learning reflection
- `data/`: Contains MSW datasets, JMP WASH data, and processed RDS files
- `data/README.md`: Documentation for data files

## Key R Packages

- `dplyr`: Core data manipulation (filter, select, mutate, summarise, group_by)
- `ggplot2`: Data visualization
- Related tidyverse packages for data analysis

## Data Focus

- **MSW Data**: Municipal solid waste generation and composition by income levels
- **WASH Data**: Water, sanitation, and hygiene indicators from JMP
- **Processed Data**: Pre-processed tables for analysis (RDS format)
- Country-level comparative datasets

## Transformation Techniques

- Filtering and selecting data subsets
- Creating new variables with mutate()
- Grouping and summarizing data
- Joining multiple datasets
- Working with categorical and continuous variables

## Key Learning Objectives

- Master dplyr verbs for data manipulation
- Work with real environmental and development datasets
- Understand data aggregation and summary statistics
- Apply transformation techniques to project data
